sort the array in DESCENDING order
count the number of swaps executed

calculate average distance between swap positions as "avg_dist"
find the max distance between swap positions as "max_dist"
both = 0, if no swap

the quickSort() function returns the number of recursive calls

if indexes are the same, nothing to handle. apply swap and increment variables accordingly
