\chapter{SysML Diagrams for Existing System and Suggestions} \label{sysml}
(This section should only be \textbf{completed by three-person groups}. Three-person groups are expected to \textbf{model SysML diagrams} in addition to UML diagrams. Three-person group scores (out of 130) will be normalized (out of 100).) 

To add this chapter to your report, you should add this file to the "main.tex" file with \textbf{include} command.
