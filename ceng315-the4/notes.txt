divide land into rectangular plots
leave least m^2 of unusable land

divide either horizontally or vertically (with integer dimensions)
divides completely through the land

divided plots cannot be joined together

dimensions of plots cannot be rotated

for each given dimension, you can create one or more plots

unusable if a piece of land is not of any given dimension after all dividing complete

input: 
    X and Y (dimensions of the land)
    bool [][] (dimensions of the plots)
        example: bool[2][3] == true, there can be a 2x3 plot

output:
    return m^2 of unusable land

int divide_land(int X, int Y, bool **possible_plots);

constraints: 
X and Y are integers <= 600
possible_plots is maximum 201x201
use dynamic programming approach
